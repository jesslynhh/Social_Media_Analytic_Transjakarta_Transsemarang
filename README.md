# Social_Media_Analytic_Transjakarta_Transsemarang

## Overview
This repository contains the code for analyzing public transportation services in Jakarta (Transjakarta) and Semarang (Trans Semarang) using sentiment analysis with a BERT-based model. As a country with 278.6 million people, Indonesia heavily relies on public transportation to support urban mobility. However, service quality issues have reduced public interest in using public transportation, leading to increased private vehicle usage, traffic congestion, and pollution.

To address these challenges, this study uses social media sentiment analysis from the X platform to assess public perceptions of Transjakarta and Trans Semarang in 2024. The developed dashboard integrates BERTopic and sentiment classification models to present key insights, including sentiment distribution, topic extraction, and tweet analysis.


## The code in this repository handles:
- Data collection from the X platform.
- Sentiment classification using BERT.
- Topic extraction via BERTopic.
